export const ABOUT: string[] = [
    "I am a software developer with hands-on experience building web and application systems using Next.js, Laravel, TypeScript, and PostgreSQL. I have contributed to production environments and independently developed real-world applications, including an actively used Laravel-based management system for a local church. My work reflects a strong foundation in software development fundamentals, database design, and API-driven architecture.",
    "Across my career, I have taken on roles such as Systems Engineer II, Project Lead Developer, Systems Analyst, IT Officer, and Computer Programmer II. These experiences strengthened my ability to design systems from the ground up, lead teams, and deliver projects on time with a focus on quality and maintainability. I am known for disciplined self-learning, effective re-ramping after time away from a stack, and reliable follow-through on project commitments.",
    "I am intentionally pursuing a long-term role as a Full-Stack Web Developer or IT Specialist within a team that values clean code, mentorship, stability, and sustainable growth. I am highly adaptable, quick to learn new tools and concepts, and motivated to deepen my expertise within a focused technology stack while contributing meaningfully to production codebases.",

export const STORY: string[] = [
    "My path to becoming a web developer began not with a single line of code, but with a question I kept asking in every role: \"How can we make this system work better?\"",
    "My career started in the world of data and analysis. At STRIDE Consulting, I worked on complex traffic simulations, installing hardware in the field and transforming raw data into clear, actionable reports using R. This experience taught me a fundamental truth: every technical system exists to serve a real-world need. I learned to see the bigger picture, from hardware setup to final data visualization.",
    "That big-picture thinking is what pulled me toward web development. I wanted to build the interfaces and tools that people actually use. I dove in headfirst, teaching myself modern front-end technologies. This led me to Citrof Group, where I had to rapidly master the T3 Stack (Next.js, TypeScript, tRPC) to contribute to live projects. It was a challenging and exhilarating confirmation that I could not only learn quickly but also deliver tangible value.",
    "Driven by a desire to own a project from concept to launch, I took on a volunteer role as a Project Lead Developer at Hills of Glory church. Starting with just an idea, I taught myself the TALL Stack (Laravel, Livewire) and led a small team to build a full church management system. This experience was pivotal—it showed me the power of technology to build community and solve specific organizational problems.",
    "Most recently, as a Systems Engineer at La Rose Noire, I focused on creating internal web systems to streamline operations, deepening my practical PHP expertise."

export const GOALS: string[] = [
    "To secure a long-term role as a Full-Stack Web Developer within a stable team that values clean code, mentorship, and sustainable growth.",
    "To deepen my expertise in a focused technology stack such as Next.js or Laravel while contributing meaningfully to production codebases.",
    "To leverage my adaptability and quick learning skills to take on increasing responsibilities and complex projects over time.",
    "Today, my focus is clear. I am seeking to channel this blend of analytical thinking, rapid learning, and full-stack project experience into a dedicated role. I want to join a collaborative engineering team where I can deepen my mastery of a modern stack like Next.js or Laravel, contribute to meaningful products, and grow alongside colleagues who value clean, impactful code.",
    "I believe great development is about understanding the \"why\" behind the \"what you're building.\" If you're looking for a developer who combines technical adaptability with a systems-thinking approach, I'd love to connect."

export const OUTSIDE_WORK: string[] = [
    "I serve as the Lead Guitarist and a Music Theory Mentor in my church's Music and Arts Ministry.",
    "This role allows me to blend technical skill with spiritual service—from crafting worship setlists and teaching foundational theory to fostering fellowship within our creative community.",
    "I deeply value the unique connection between creative expression and spiritual growth that this ministry nurtures."
